Tired of ordinary Facebook ? I got you.

This is a simple Facebook clone with most of Facebook's functionality.

Users can create an account and login. They can create and delete their own posts, with a photo if they want to, like, and add or delete comments. 

You can search for your friends, send them a friend request, accept or reject your friend requests, and, if there's that one guy with a bad attitude, u can delete him from your friends list.

Users can also change their email, password, fullname, and profile picture.
